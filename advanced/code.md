# Codes in markdown
This README will teach you how to create _codeblocks_ and _inline code_ in markdown

### Inline code
For inline code, follow the below syntax
```
`inline code`
```

the results are `inline code`, amazing!

### For codeblocks, follow this syntax
```
```
print("Hello world")
```
```

the results are 
```
print("Hello world")
```
**Fact**: Based on the provider, you may see other types of codeblockes. In Github, we only have copy button, while some AI assistants(like ChatGPT or Github Copilot) provide language names and syntax highlighting
