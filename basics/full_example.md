# **Marker**
**Marker** is a full-stack markdown editor for you, developers!
It's web, desktop and mobile versions make it easy to create and view your markdown right there!
By allowing **Marker** to access your `Github`(also `Gitlab` or `Bitbucket`) it is so much easier to add markdown to your repo!

## How to use Markdown(desktop)
First, ensure your git on your desktop isn't obsolete. If obsolete, to this
```
git install -v 2.13
git restart
# Restart your computer
```  
##### then, log in to your git.
```
git login
git updateUser user.name "Username"
git updateUser user.email "example@gmail.com"
```
And now, you can start installing `Marker`
##### First download the Installer.
```
curl https://marker.md/installer/version1.0 -i
```
#### After loging in, you can easily clone your repos and work
[!]: If your device doesn't have an IDE(supported ones: Pony, VSCode, Webstorm, Nvim), you have to install `CodeMarker` which is very minimal and easy to work with
